<h2>Future Goals</h2>
<p>These are mostly just ideas of what I might want out of my life. Many can't or aren't likely to occur if I succeed at others.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Software Engineer</dt>
		<dd>As I have learned more about computer science and programming I have become more interested in maybe pursuing a career in the industry. 
		If I were to pursue a career I am unsure whether I would want to pursue more education or hop right into industry</dd>
	<dt>Research in math</dt>
		<dd>An older goal I wanted to pursue that I am still interested in. I think it would be especially cool to do research into math theory. Applied mathematics 
		research would however also be fun to research.</dd>
	<dt>High level Magic: the Gathering</dt>
		<dd>Not a professional goal but definitley something I want to do. I have always been an avid Magic player and I feel like it would be fun to show off 
		my skills at a higher level.</dd>
