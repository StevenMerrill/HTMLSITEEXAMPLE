# HTMLSITEEXAMPLE
Sample of a basic project I did with HTML
The project was iterated on as I learned skills. Pages like Fun JavaScript I implemented just to try things.
Although I love the form in this store I am a little bothered by the formatting issue of the receipt/invoice that the user receives from the form.
Oftentimes I just did goofy things to meet requirements for the project like flipping the homescreen photo upside down.
Project was completed in December of 2022
