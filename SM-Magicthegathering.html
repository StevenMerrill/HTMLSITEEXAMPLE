<h2>Magic:the Gathering</h2>
<p>Magic: the Gathering is trading card game that I play. I generally play Standard and Limited. Standard is a format that involves playing using a card pool of recently 
released cards. Limited involves opening packs and playing with the cards that you receive.</p>
<h2>Preferred Colors</h2>
<p>I don't have much of a preference of colors. I have a slight soft spot for <span style="color:darkred;">red</span>. However 
when playing limited I feel like I lean towards <span style="color:green;">green</span>.</p>
<h2>To Brew or not to Brew?</h2>
<p>When it comes down to deck brewing their are inherent risks to homebrew. Mainly since the Meta is so dominant it is hard to come up with strategies that compete.
I am however a big fan of brewing and coming up with ideas that are different than the meta. I also have experienced success in my endeavors.</p>
<h2>Limited Policy</h2>
<p>I don't believe that their are any set ways to play limited, I do however believe that limited is quite like constructed in the idea that it is still completley necessary to have a plan.
I also believe that limited might be helped by pulls, but the biggest factor in limited is how you build your deck.</p>
